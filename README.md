  Metalsmith blog starter
</h1>

> **This starter is deprecated. Use the [Metalsmith2025 Simple Starter](https://github.com/wernerglinka/metalsmith2025-simple-starter) instead!**

Start off your Metalsmith journey with this blog boilerplate. This starter is based on the [Metalsmith bare-bones starter](https://github.com/wernerglinka/metalsmith-bare-bones-starter) but also includes a blog landing page and several "greek" blog posts. Check out a [demo of this starter](https://metalsmith-blog-starter.netlify.app/).

## Quick start

1.  **Create a Metalsmith site.**

    Clone the starter repository to create a new blog.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/wernerglinka/metalsmith-blog-starter my-blog
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-blog/
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:3000`!

    Open the `my-blog` directory in your code editor of choice and edit any page. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
