This Metalsmith starter website will get you started with building a blog. It uses Markdown to write content and the Nunjucks templating language to build pages.

The site is an extension of the [Metalsmith bare-bones starter](https://github.com/wernerglinka/metalsmith-bare-bones-starter) with the addition of the blog landing page and several "greek" blogposts.

The rest is left to your imagination.
